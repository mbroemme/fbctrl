FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions
================================

Q: What is 'fbctrl'?
A: 'fbctrl' is an application to switch the window on a
   compatible to the next or previous one.

Q: What is needed?
A: You need a compatible window manager like fluxbox, blackbox
   or openbox.

Q: Why did you start this project?
A: Well i was migrating from fluxbox 0.1.14 to fluxbox 1.0rc3 and
   it was not possible to recover the old window switch behaviour.

Q: Why did not extend fluxbox itself?
A: Simple answer: I have no real knowledge about C++ and so i did
   not really understand what is done in FocusControl::cycleFocus()
   Look at the README for detailed information.

Q: Why not using bbkeys or wmctrl?
A: Simple answer: bbkeys requires blackbox to compile and has other
   drawbacks and wmctrl can not do what i want. Also look at the
   README for detailed information.

Q: I have a cool idea for 'fbctrl' but don't know C.
A: No problem, i started this utility to enhance the new fluxbox
   with some of the old behaviour. So look at the authors file and
   send me an email.
